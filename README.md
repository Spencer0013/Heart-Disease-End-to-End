## About The Project

![https://th.bing.com/th?id=OIF.ZZk2mD%2bKdV9C%2fUZKNjB4eQ&cb=iwp2&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain](https://th.bing.com/th?id=OIF.ZZk2mD%2bKdV9C%2fUZKNjB4eQ&cb=iwp2&rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain)

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using Machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains 303 records with 14 features, including age, sex, chest pain type, and others. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training with Scikit-Learn's Logistic Regression, and deployment of the model using AWS Sage Maker. Key steps include data preprocessing, model evaluation using metrics like ROC curves, and endpoint management on Sage Maker.
### Built With

- [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
- [AWS SageMaker:](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
- [Seaborn:](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- [Pandas:](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
## Getting Started

To run this project locally or deploy it on AWS Sage Maker, follow the steps below.
### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  Python
  AWS account with Sage maker Access
  ```
### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   https://github.com/Spencer0013/Heart-Disease-End-to-End.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```js
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Roadmap

Load and preprocess the UCI Heart Disease dataset



Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)



Train a Logistic Regression model


Evaluate model performance with ROC curve and other metrics



Deploy the model to AWS Sage Maker



Add additional models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for comparison



Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV



Add feature engineering to improve model performance



Create a web interface for real-time predictions
