## About The Project

![https://assets.quizgecko.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=90,format=webp/quiz/e8f42a3a8faa93e7e21a256001ad8c3f.jpg](https://assets.quizgecko.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=800,quality=90,format=webp/quiz/e8f42a3a8faa93e7e21a256001ad8c3f.jpg)

This project is an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying images of animals. It leverages a pre-trained MobileNetV2 feature extractor (from TensorFlow Hub) to rapidly learn rich image representations and adds a custom classifier head for your specific animal categories. Key highlights include:

Data Preparation: Automated loading, and Splitiing.

Modeling: Baseline CNN as well as transfer-learning with MobileNetV2, complete with callbacks for early stopping, checkpointing, and learning-rate scheduling.

Evaluation: Detailed metrics, confusion matrix visualization, and batch-prediction utilities for assessing performance.

Inference: Simple scripts for single-image and batch predictions, ready to integrate into larger applications or demos.
